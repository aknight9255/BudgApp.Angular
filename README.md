## BudgApp

BudgApp is a fun but useful budgeting app. In the main page you will find three boxes that will show what your next three months of budgeting looks like starting with the current month. You also have the ability to look at all transactions or incomes that have been entered. In the overview page you are able to get a look at your spending overall. With a doughnut graph it shows you a breakdown of all transactions based on category. 

What we would include in a version 2.0: 

Calendar view that shows when payday falls and when bills fall with a badge that shows easily the difference between the two. 

We would also like to be able to set income or bills as recurring so you wonâ€™t have to enter them every month just update when needed.
